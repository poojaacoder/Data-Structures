- the last level nodes are called leaf nodes


### binary tree
- a tree which has atmost 2 child nodes
- types of binary trees

1. full binary tree : a binary tree which has either 0 or 2 nodes

2. perfect binary tree : each parent node should have 2 childrens , except leaf nodes

3. complete binary tree: perfect binary tree , where last leaf node can be absent

## N-ary tree

having n nodes

## Traversal

1. preorder:  root -> left -> right

2. Postorder: left -> right -> root

3. Inorder : left -> root -> right


## Binary search Tree (BST)

- constraints 
- all nodes have atmost two childrens
- left node should be less than parent node
- right node should be greater than parent node

- ways of traversing BST 
1. DFS
2. BFS
